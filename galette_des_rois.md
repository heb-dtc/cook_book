### Directions for the almond cream
```
Take the butter out of the fridge a bit before so it become soft.
Once soft enough, work it with a wooden spoon to soften it even more.
Add the sugar and mix it up.
Then add the egg and mix up.
Finally add the almond powder.
```

### Directions for the galette
```
Mix the cold cream patissiere and the almond cream together to make the franginpane.
Put the frangipane onto some puff pastry.
Circle it with some egg yolk and recover it all with some puff pastry. 
The egg yolk will act like a glue and seal the puff pastry together. 
Cover the top of the galette with some egg yolk and decorate the pastry.
Finally, make sure to add a little chimney at the top of the galette.

Cook at 200 degrees for 10 minutes then 170 degrees for 20 minutes.
